The following bar plot shows probability of declaring efficacy for each scenario and decision criterion (number of events).
The strong scenario simulates hazard ratios from a prior based on historical data.
Under the "no efficacy" scenario, the hazard ratio is equal to 1, and the probability of efficacy should not exceed 0.05.
